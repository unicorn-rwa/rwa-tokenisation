# RWA Real Estate — Smart Contracts

Solidity contracts for a Real World Asset (RWA) investment platform. Investors fund
US real estate construction projects using USDC on Base. Each project is backed by a
security token. KYC is enforced on-chain. ROI is distributed via Merkle tree when
construction completes.

## How It Works

### Actors

| Actor | Address | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Admin** | Gnosis Safe 3-of-5 | Creates projects, triggers state transitions, withdraws funds |
| **Attester** | NestJS hot wallet | Issues and revokes KYC attestations after off-chain verification |
| **Investor (US)** | Wallet | Reg D 506(c) — must be an accredited investor |
| **Investor (non-US)** | Wallet | Reg S — non-US person, identity + sanctions checked |
| **Multisig** | Gnosis Safe | Receives raised USDC for fiat conversion |

---

### Contract Overview

```
KYCRegistry
  Stores on-chain attestations for every verified investor.
  Two tracks: accredited investor (Reg D) and Reg S eligible (non-US).
  Read by every other contract before any money moves.

PropertyToken  (one deployed per project)
  ERC-20 security token. Minted to investors on investment.
  KYC compliance hook: every wallet-to-wallet transfer checks the
  recipient's attestation. Mint and burn bypass this check.
  Transfers between investors are locked during construction (v1).

PropertyFunding  (one deployed per project)
  Accepts USDC investments, mints PropertyTokens.
  Runs the project state machine.
  Anyone can trigger refund mode once deadline passes with goal unmet.

PropertyFundingFactory
  Admin entry point. Deploys a matched PropertyToken + PropertyFunding
  pair, wires up roles, then relinquishes its own privileges.

ROIDistributor
  Accepts a USDC deposit from admin (principal + ROI for all investors).
  Uses a Merkle tree so investors claim individually — no gas-heavy loops.
  Burns PropertyTokens on claim.
```

### Project State Machine

A project moves through these states in order. No state can be skipped or reversed.

    │                                                     │
    │                                                COMPLETED
    │                                          (ROIDistributor takes over)
    │
    └─ (deadline passed, goal not met) ─────────────► REFUNDING
                                                          │
                                                (investors claimRefund())
                                                          │
                                                       REFUNDED
```

State | Who triggers | What happens
------|--------------|-------------
`FUNDRAISING` | — | Open for investment. Anyone with valid KYC can invest.
`FUNDED` | Auto (last invest that hits goal) | Goal met. Admin can now withdraw.
`WITHDRAWN` | `admin.withdrawFunds()` | USDC sent to Gnosis Safe → Coinbase Prime → fiat.
`ACTIVE` | `admin.setActive()` | Confirms fiat conversion done, construction started.
`COMPLETED` | `admin.setCompleted()` | Construction done. ROIDistributor handles payouts.
`REFUNDING` | Anyone calls `triggerRefund()` | Deadline passed, goal unmet. Investors claim back.
`REFUNDED` | Informational | All refunds claimed.

---

### Investment Flow (Investor perspective)

```
1. Complete KYC
     US investor  → Synaps (identity) + Parallel Markets (accredited investor check)
     non-US       → Synaps only (identity + sanctions)

2. Backend issues EAS attestation on-chain for your wallet

3. Approve USDC spend
     usdc.approve(propertyFundingAddress, amount)

4. Call invest()
     funding.invest(usdcAmount)
     → Contract checks: KYC valid? Deadline not passed? Above minimum? State = FUNDRAISING?
     → USDC pulled from your wallet into the contract
     → PropertyTokens minted to your wallet (1 USDC = 1 token, scaled for decimals)
     → If total raised hits funding goal: state transitions to FUNDED automatically

5. Wait during construction
     Tokens are locked (non-transferable) while the project is ACTIVE.

6. Claim ROI when project completes
     distributor.claim(projectAddress, claimableAmount, merkleProof)
     → Merkle proof fetched from backend: GET /api/projects/{id}/proof/{wallet}
     → USDC (principal + ROI) transferred to your wallet
     → PropertyTokens burned
```

---

### Refund Flow (when project fails to raise enough)

```
1. Deadline passes with totalRaised < fundingGoal
2. Anyone calls funding.triggerRefund() — no admin required, trustless
3. Each investor calls funding.claimRefund()
   → Their investment is returned in full
   → Their PropertyTokens are burned
```

---

### ROI Distribution (Merkle tree)

Why Merkle and not a simple loop? A loop over 100+ investors can hit the block gas limit
and is vulnerable to griefing (one bad address reverts the whole payout). Merkle lets
each investor claim independently at their own gas cost.

```
Admin workflow when project completes:
  1. Read all investors and their investment amounts from on-chain events
  2. Compute each investor's claimable USDC:
       claimable = investment + (investment * roiBps / 10_000)
  3. Build Merkle tree: leaf = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(wallet, claimableAmount))
  4. Call distributor.depositReturns(projectAddress, merkleRoot, totalUSDC)

Investor workflow:
  1. GET /api/projects/{id}/proof/{wallet} → { claimableAmount, proof[] }
  2. Call distributor.claim(projectAddress, claimableAmount, proof)
```

---

### KYC Registry

Every operation that moves money or tokens checks `KYCRegistry` first.

```
isVerified(wallet)         → kycPassed && !revoked && block.timestamp < expiresAt
isAccredited(wallet)       → isVerified + accreditedInvestor flag (Reg D)
isRegSEligible(wallet)     → isVerified + regSEligible flag (Reg S)
isEligibleInvestor(wallet) → isAccredited || isRegSEligible
```

Attestations expire (max 1 year). The backend sends renewal emails 30 days before expiry.
On PM webhook `accreditation.expired`: backend calls `registry.revokeAttestation(wallet)`.

The `pmIdHashToWallet` mapping (`keccak256(pmInvestorId) → wallet`) lets the backend
reverse-lookup which wallet a Parallel Markets webhook refers to without storing PII
in the contract.

---

### Security Model

**Access control** (OpenZeppelin `AccessControl`):

| Role | Holder | Can do |
|---|---|---|
| `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` | Hardware wallet / Gnosis Safe | Manage all roles |
| `ADMIN_ROLE` | Gnosis Safe 3-of-5 | State transitions, fund withdrawal, ROI deposit |
| `ATTESTER_ROLE` | NestJS hot wallet | Issue / revoke / update attestations |
| `PAUSER_ROLE` | Gnosis Safe | Emergency pause all contracts |
| `MINTER_ROLE` | PropertyFunding + ROIDistributor | Mint/burn PropertyTokens |

**Reentrancy**: All fund-moving functions carry `nonReentrant`. The invest / refund
functions also follow Checks-Effects-Interactions — state is zeroed before any external
call, so a reentrant attempt finds nothing to claim even if the lock were bypassed.

**ERC-3643 compliance pattern**: `PropertyToken._update()` rejects wallet-to-wallet
transfers where the recipient is not KYC-verified. Mint (`from == 0`) and burn
(`to == 0`) bypass this check intentionally — they are internal operations.

**Note**: This is an ERC-3643-*inspired* pattern, not full T-REX standard compliance.
